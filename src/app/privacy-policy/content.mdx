## Privacy Policy

### Overview

Snable is committed to protecting your privacy. Our Chrome extension operates primarily within your browser and is designed with user privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected, used, and secured when you use our extension.

### Data Collection and Usage

#### Local Data Processing

When you manually activate the extension, it extracts visual information from the current webpage. This includes non-sensitive data such as the favicon, URL, and title of the active tab. All data is processed locally in your browser to provide immediate functionality.

#### Data Transmission for Advertising and Analysis

Only when you actively launch the extension does it securely transmit the following non-sensitive data from the active tab to our servers:

- **Favicon:** The icon associated with the active tab (if available)
- **URL:** The URL of the active tab
- **Title:** The title of the active tab

This data is used exclusively for:

- **Advertising purposes:** Displaying on our landing page to showcase websites where the extension is used.
- **Audience analysis:** Understanding usage patterns to improve our services.

**Note:** The extension does not collect any personal information, track your browsing history, or operate in the background. Data is only collected when you actively use the extension.

## How the Extension Works

1. **User Activation:** The extension only activates when you choose to use it.
2. **Local Data Extraction:** Upon activation, it extracts non-sensitive visual data (favicon, URL, title) from the active tab.
3. **Local Processing:** The extracted data is processed locally in your browser.
4. **Data Transmission:** Selected data is securely transmitted to our servers for advertising and analysis purposes.
5. **No Background Collection:** The extension does not run in the background; data is only collected during active use.

### Permissions

The extension requires the "activeTab" permission to:

- Access visual elements of the current webpage when you activate the extension.
- Extract and analyze non-sensitive data (favicon, URL, title) from the active tab.

This permission is used solely to enable the functionality described above and does not allow background tracking.

### Data Security

All transmitted data is handled with standard security measures to ensure safe transit and storage. Since only non-sensitive data from the active tab is collected during active use, the risk to your privacy is minimal.

### Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy as we improve our extension. Any changes will be reflected here and in the extension documentation.
